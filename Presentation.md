# Brief Introduction

# Assumptions

- shares & rate numbers have 16 digits of decimal places.
- I wasn't clear about how to pass headers to the v4-client for CORS, so I worked around it by disabling cors
- I did not extract icons from every validator. I attempted to fetch their favicon. It be better to download them
- I did not have permissions to create a branch, so I created a PR through a fork

# What would I have done if I had more time

- Write tests
- Download the icons for every validator into `/public`
- There looks to be a gap style in the . I wrapped the table into a styled `<div />`, but perhaps there are other tools
- To align the table borders with the top toolbar, I had to make some peculiar adjustments. I would have liked to study the css in the codebase more to see if there could be a better solution
