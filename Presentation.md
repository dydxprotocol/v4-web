# Brief Introduction

# Assumptions

- shares & rate numbers have 16 digits of decimal places.
- I wasn't clear about how to pass headers to the v4-client for CORS, so I worked around it by disabling cors
- I did not extract icons from every validator. I attempted to fetch their favicon. It be better to download them
