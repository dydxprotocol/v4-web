      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          7.1. You acknowledge that certain aspects of the Services may use, incorporate or link to
          certain open-source components and that your use of the Services is subject to, and you
          will comply with, any applicable open-source licenses and terms of use that govern any
          such open-source components, including terms of use with respect to v4 software, available
          at https://dydx.exchange/legal (collectively, the “Open-Source Licenses”). Without
          limiting the generality of the foregoing, you may not (a) resell, lease, lend, share,
          distribute, or otherwise permit any third party to use the Services; (b) use the Services
          for time-sharing or service bureau purposes; or (c) otherwise use the Services in a manner
          that violates the Open-Source Licenses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          7.2. Excluding third-party software that the Services incorporates, as between you and us,
          we own the Services, including all technology, content and other materials used, displayed
          or provided on the Site or in connection with the Services (including all intellectual
          property rights subsisting therein, whether or not subject to the Open-Source Licenses),
          and hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable,
          non-sublicensable license to access and use those portions of the Services that are
          proprietary to us and not available pursuant to the Open-Source Licenses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          7.3. Any of our product or service names, logos, and other marks used as a part of the
          Services, including our name and logo, are trademarks owned by us or our licensors. You
          may not copy, imitate, or use them without the prior written consent of us or the
          applicable licensors, and these Terms do not grant you any rights in those trademarks. You
          may not remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with the
          Services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          7.4. The Services are non-custodial. When you deposit Digital Assets into any smart
          contract available on the Interface, you are not transferring Digital Assets to us, and
          you retain control over those Digital Assets at all times. The private key associated with
          the blockchain address from which you transfer Digital Assets is the only private key that
          can control the Digital Assets you transfer into the smart contracts available on the
          Interface.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>8. LINKS</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Services or third parties may provide links to other World Wide Web or accessible sites,
        applications, or resources. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the
        availability of such external sites, applications or resources, and do not endorse and are
        not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or
        available from such sites or resources. You further acknowledge and agree that we will not
        be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged
        to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods, or
        services available on or through any such site or resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>9. MODIFICATION, SUSPENSION, AND TERMINATION</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We may, at our sole discretion, from time to time and with or without prior notice to you,
        modify, suspend or disable (temporarily or permanently) the Services, in whole or in part,
        for any reason whatsoever, including to only allow open Perpetual Contracts to be closed.
        Upon termination of your access, your right to use the Services will immediately cease. We
        will not be liable for any losses suffered by you resulting from any modification to any
        Services or from any modification, suspension or termination, for any reason, of your access
        to all or any portion of the Services. The following sections of these Terms will survive
        any termination of your access to the Services, regardless of the reasons for its expiration
        or termination, in addition to any other provision which by law or by its nature should
        survive: Section 7 and Sections 9 through Section 17.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>10. RISKS</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          10.1. By accessing or using the Services , you understand and agree to the inherent risks
          associated with cryptographic systems and blockchain-based networks; Digital Assets,
          including the usage and intricacies of native Digital Assets; smart contract-based tokens,
          including fungible tokens and NFTs; and systems that interact with blockchain-based
          networks. We do not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain
          networks are formed. In general, the software underlying blockchain-based networks is open
          source, such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Services,
          you acknowledge and agree (a) that we are not responsible for the operation of the
          blockchain-based software and networks underlying the Services, (b) that there exists no
          guarantee of the functionality, security, or availability of that software and networks,
          and (c) that the underlying blockchain-based networks are subject to sudden changes in
          operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as “forks,” which may materially
          affect the Services. Blockchain networks use public and private key cryptography. You
          alone are responsible for securing your private key(s). We do not have access to your
          private key(s). Losing control of your private key(s) will permanently and irreversibly
          deny you access to Digital Assets on the applicable blockchain-based networks. Neither we
          nor any other person or entity will be able to retrieve or protect your Digital Assets. If
          your private key(s) are lost, then you will not be able to transfer your Digital Assets to
          any other blockchain address or wallet. If this occurs, then you will not be able to
          realize any value or utility from the Digital Assets that you may hold.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          10.2. You acknowledge and understand that the Services and your Digital Assets could be
          impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or
          limit our ability to continue to make available our proprietary software and could impede
          or limit your ability to access or use the Services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          10.3. You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field with
          advances in code cracking or other technical advancements, such as the development of
          quantum computers, which may present risks to Digital Assets and the Services, and could
          result in the theft or loss of your Digital Assets. To the extent possible, the smart
          contracts available on the Interface will be updated to account for any advances in
          cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures necessary to address risks
          presented from technological advancements, but that intention does not guarantee or
          otherwise ensure full security of the Services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          10.4. You understand that blockchain-based networks remain under development, which
          creates technological and security risks when using the Services in addition to
          uncertainty relating to Digital Assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the
          cost of transacting on any blockchain-based network is variable and may increase at any
          time causing impact to any activities taking place on the applicable blockchain-based
          network, which may result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using the
          Services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          10.5. You acknowledge that the Services are subject to flaws and that you are solely
          responsible for evaluating any code provided relating to the Services. This warning and
          other warnings that we provide in these Terms are in no way evidence or represent an
          on-going duty to alert you to all of the potential risks of utilizing the Services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          10.6. Although we intend to provide accurate and timely information and data on the Site
          and during your use of the Services, the Site and other information available when using
          the Services may not always be entirely accurate, complete, or current and may also
          include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. To continue to provide you with as
          complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from
          time to time without notice, including information regarding our policies. Accordingly,
          you acknowledge and understand that you should verify all information before relying on
          it, and all decisions based on information contained on as part of the Services are your
          sole responsibility. No representation is made as to the accuracy, completeness, or
          appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing information distributed via the
          Site or otherwise when using the Services. Prices and pricing information may be higher or
          lower than prices available on platforms providing similar services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          10.7. Any use or interaction with the Services requires a comprehensive understanding of
          applied cryptography and computer science to appreciate the inherent risks, including
          those listed above. You represent and warrant that you possess relevant knowledge and
          skills. Any reference to a type of Digital Asset on the Site or otherwise during the use
          of the Services does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the technology on which
          the Digital Asset relies, and should not be used as a substitute for your understanding of
          the risks specific to each type of Digital Asset.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          10.8. Use of the Services in particular for entering into Perpetual Contracts may carry
          financial risk. Digital Assets, especially in connection with Perpetual Contracts, are, by
          their nature, highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered into in
          connection with the Services are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You
          acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Services at your own risk. The risk
          of loss in trading Digital Assets, especially entering into Perpetual Contracts, can be
          substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable
          for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Services, you
          represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making
          your independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and
          the underlying Digital Assets, including Perpetual Contracts. You represent that you have
          sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make
          your evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted in connection with
          the Services or any Digital Asset. You accept all consequences of using the Services,
          including the risk that you may lose access to your Digital Assets indefinitely. All
          transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms, we
          accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no circumstances be liable to you for
          any loss or injury sustained by you or any third parties in connection with, your use of
          the Services for performing Digital Asset transactions, including entering into Perpetual
          Contracts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          10.9. We must comply with Applicable Law, which may require us to, upon request by
          government agencies, take certain actions or provide information. You acknowledge and
          understand that we may in our sole discretion take any action it deems appropriate to
          cooperate with government agencies or comply with Applicable Law.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          10.10. You understand that you are responsible for all trades you place, including any
          erroneous orders that may be filled. We do not take any action to resolve erroneous trades
          that result from your errors.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          10.11. You hereby assume the risks set forth in this Section 10 and Section 2, and
          acknowledge and agree that we will have no responsibility or liability for the risks set
          forth in this Section 10. You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims,
          whether known or unknown to you, against us and our shareholders, members, directors,
          officers, employees, agents, and representatives, suppliers, and contractors
          (“Representatives”) related to any of the risks set forth in this Section 10 and Section
          2.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>11. INDEMNIFICATION</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us and our Representatives (collectively,
        “Indemnified Parties”) from any claim, demand, lawsuit, action, proceeding, investigation,
        liability, damage, loss, cost or expense, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out
        of or relating to (a) your use of, or conduct in connection with the Services; (b) Digital
        Assets associated with your blockchain address; (c) any feedback or user content you provide
        to us, if any, concerning the Services; (d) your violation of these Terms; or (e) your
        infringement or misappropriation of the rights of any other person or entity. If you are
        obligated to indemnify any Indemnified Party, us (or, at our sole discretion, the applicable
        Indemnified Party) will have the right, in our or its sole discretion, to control any action
        or proceeding and to determine whether we wish to settle, and if so, on what terms, and you
        agree to cooperate with us in the defense.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>12. DISCLOSURES; DISCLAIMERS</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          12.1 We are a developer of software. We do not operate a Digital Asset or derivatives
          exchange platform or offer trade execution or clearing services and have no oversight,
          involvement, or control concerning your transactions using the Services. All transactions
          between users of the Interface are executed peer-to-peer directly between the users’
          blockchain addresses through a smart contract. You are responsible for complying with all
          Applicable Laws that govern your Digital Assets. As a result of restrictions under the
          Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Commodity
          Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), no Blocked Person may enter into Perpetual Contracts
          using the Services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          12.2 You understand that we are not registered or licensed by any regulatory agency or
          authority. No such agency or authority has reviewed or approved the use of the Services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          12.3 To the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, the Services (and any of their
          content or functionality) provided by or on behalf of us are provided on an “AS IS” and
          “AS AVAILABLE” basis, and we expressly disclaim, and you hereby waive, any
          representations, conditions or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, legal,
          statutory or otherwise, or arising from statute, otherwise in law, course of dealing, or
          usage of trade, including the implied or legal warranties and conditions of
          merchantability, merchantable quality, quality or fitness for a particular purpose, title,
          security, availability, reliability, accuracy, quiet enjoyment and non-infringement of
          third party rights. Without limiting the foregoing, we do not represent or warrant that
          the Services (including any data relating thereto) will be uninterrupted, available at any
          particular time, or error-free. Further, we do not warrant that errors in the Services are
          correctable or will be correctable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          12.4 You acknowledge that data you provide while accessing or using the Services may
          become irretrievably lost or corrupted or temporarily unavailable due to a variety of
          causes, and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, we will not
          be liable for any loss or damage caused by denial-of-service attacks, software failures,
          viruses or other technologically harmful materials (including those which may infect your
          computer equipment), protocol changes by third-party providers, Internet outages, force
          majeure events or other disasters, scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, or other causes
          either within or outside of our control.

        <strong>13. LIMITATION OF DAMAGES; EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED DAMAGES</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          13.1 Without limitation of any other provision of these Terms, you hereby agree that
          neither we, any software developers of the Services nor any of its Representatives will
          have any responsibility or liability whatsoever for any loss or injury sustained by you or
          any third parties as a result of (i) any equipment or technology or other infrastructure
          delay, inaccessibility, or malfunctions; (ii) periodic maintenance procedures or repairs
          that we or any of our suppliers or contractors may undertake from time to time; (iii)
          causes beyond our control or that we could not reasonably foresee; (iv) disruptions and
          temporary or permanent unavailability of underlying blockchain infrastructure; or (v)
          unavailability of third-party service providers or external partners for any reason. Under
          no circumstances will we or our Representatives have any liability for any such loss or
          injury caused by any of the foregoing events, including but not limited to any obligation
          to cover or reimburse any damages or losses caused by such events. You expressly
          acknowledge that any risk of loss resulting from such events shall be borne by you, and
          you expressly assume any and all such risks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          13.2 In no event will we, our suppliers and contractors, and our or our suppliers’ and
          contractors’ respective stockholders, members, directors, officers, managers, employees,
          attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers and contractors (collectively, the “Risk
          Limited Parties”) be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive, consequential
          or similar damages or liabilities whatsoever (including damages for loss of fiat, assets,
          data, information, revenue, opportunities, use, goodwill, profits or other business or
          financial benefit) arising out of or in connection with the Services (and any of their
          content and functionality), any execution or settlement of a transaction, any performance
          or non-performance of the Services, your Digital Assets, Perpetual Contracts or any other
          product, service or other item provided by or on behalf of us, whether under contract,
          tort (including negligence), civil liability statute strict liability breach of warranties
          or under any other theory of liability and whether or not we have been advised of, knew of
          or should have known of the possibility of such damages and, notwithstanding any failure
          of the essential purpose of these Terms or any limited remedy hereunder, nor are we in any
          way responsible for the execution or settlement of transactions between users of the
          Services.

        party are found liable under these Terms, our aggregate liability (together with our equity
        owners, members, directors, managers, officers, employees, attorneys, agents,

        <strong>15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT YOUR LEGAL
        RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT AGAINST US IN ANY COURT OR GOVERNING
        AUTHORITY. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED BELOW, THIS SECTION REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT ANY
        DISPUTE, CLAIM, OR DISAGREEMENT (EACH A “DISPUTE”) ARISING OUT OF THESE TERMS OR THE
        SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE THAT AROSE BEFORE THE EFFECTIVE DATES OF THESE TERMS, TO
        BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. THIS SECTION EXTENDS TO DISPUTES THAT AROSE OR INVOLVE FACTS
        OCCURING BEFORE THE EXISTENCE OF THIS OR ANY PRIOR VERSIONS OF THE TERMS AS WELL AS DISPUTES
        THAT MAY ARISE AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THE TERMS.
      </p>
      <p>
        You and we agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services
        is personal to you and us and that any Dispute will be resolved solely through individual
        arbitration, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type
        of representative proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing in this Section precludes you or we from bringing an individual action for damages
        in a small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court, or from
        seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in court for infringement or other alleged
        misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade
        secrets, copyrights, and patents).
      </p>
      <p>
        Except as specified above, you and we waive the rights to a judge or jury trial or to have
        any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services resolved in court.
        Instead, for any Dispute that you have against us or relating in any way to the Services,
        you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a
        written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to us by email using the information set forth in
        Section 19. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and
        telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the
        specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above.
        If you and we cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after
        such Notice is received, then either party may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration
        administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All
        Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before
        one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in San Francisco, California, under the
        JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of
        the JAMS Rules is available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference.
        You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive
        your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair
        or should not apply for any reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        You and we agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of
        this Section 15 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration
        Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
        As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive
        authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to
        grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to
        determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual
        arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type
        of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one
        individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        The arbitrator, we, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration
        proceedings, judgments and awards, including all information gathered, prepared, and
        presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The
        arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality
        unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the
        extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the
        merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection
        with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that
        disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        You and we agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and all
        other JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by us, we will pay all JAMS fees
        and costs. You and we agree that the state or federal courts of the State of Delaware have
        exclusive jurisdiction over the enforcement of an arbitration award.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or the Services must be filed within one
        (1) year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is permanently barred, which means
        that you and we will not have the right to assert the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any portion of this Section 15 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason,
        (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms; (b) severance
        of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder
        of this Section 15 or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on
        an individual basis under this Section 15; and (c) to the extent that any claims must
        therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims
        must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the
        parties agree that litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any
        individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 15 is found to
        prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, then that provision will have
        no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the
        remainder of this Section 15 will be enforceable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>16. GOVERNING LAW</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and any Dispute related to these Terms or
        the Services, will be governed by and construed and enforced under the laws of the State of
        Delaware, as applicable, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of
        the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
        laws of any other jurisdiction. You agree that we may initiate a proceeding related to the
        enforcement or validity of our intellectual property rights in any court having
        jurisdiction. For any other proceeding that is not subject to arbitration under these Terms,
        the state and federal courts located in Delaware will have exclusive jurisdiction. You waive
        any objection to venue in any such courts.
      </p>
