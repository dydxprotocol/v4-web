# Contributing to V4-web
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code, thoroughly test your code locally.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the same License
When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [License](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-web/blob/master/LICENSE) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-web/issues)
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-web/issues/new).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Attach screenshots or videos
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
